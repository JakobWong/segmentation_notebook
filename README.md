# segmentation_notebook
This repository contains some note I have written when studying semantic segmentation

## Contents

1. `DeepLab_ADE20K.ipynb`

This notebook is a demo for using an ADE20K-pretrained DeepLabv3 network for semantic segmentation

2. `DeepLab_Cityspaces.ipynb`

This notebook is a demo for using an Cityspaces-pretrained DeepLabv3 network for semantic segmentation

3. `DeepLab_PASCAL_VOC_2012.ipynb`

This notebook is a demo for using an PASCAL-pretrained DeepLabv3 network for semantic segmentation

## Usage

Please download the pre-trained weights on [model_zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/model_zoo.md)


## Acknowledgement

Thanks google for providing pre-trained weights on github.
